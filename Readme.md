# <font color = "#FF8000">Ru</font><font color = "#FF0000">Cos</font> is an extremely high-performance parallel constraint solver implemented by Rust.

# <font color = "#FF8000">Ru</font><font color = "#FF0000">Cos</font>  is implemented by safe, elegant and lower-level code with zero-cost abstraction. 

# <font color = "#FF8000">Ru</font><font color = "#FF0000">Cos</font> is a total Test-Driven developed solver.

# I have implemented an XCSP3 parser whose repo is [xcsp3-rust](https://github.com/luhanzhen/xcsp3-rust).

# I will implement the main part of the solver and some typical types of constraints first.

# The process of implementing the solver could take years, but I will keep updating....
